/__w/ig-mal/ig-mal/mal/fsh-generated/resources/StructureDefinition-mal-patient.json: line 1, col 24113, Warning - There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-citizenship'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer. Using version '5.2.0', found versions: 4.0.1, 5.2.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-citizenship' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-citizenship|5.2.0' (INVALID)
